# C++/Cmake experiments

In this repo I am experimenting with C++ and the cmake toolchain, using Visual Studio Code as an IDE. It's just here for my own hands-on learning purposes and may be not very useful for you (yet).

## What am I trying to do here?

* Testing how C++ development with CMake works with G++, Visual Studio Code on Mac, Linux and Windows
* Getting familiar with some modern C++17 features
* Implement a linked list data structure (without using containers like `std::vector` from the standard library)

## IDE

I am using the following extensions:

* C/C++ (ms-vscode.cpptools)
* CMake Tools (vector-of-bool.cmake-tools)

## Todos

* Figure out how to do unit testing?
* documentation
